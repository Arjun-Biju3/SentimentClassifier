# Sentiment Prediction Using Images

This project implements a deep learning model to predict sentiment (e.g., happy, sad, neutral) from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By analyzing facial expressions in input images, the model classifies the sentiment of the subject.

## 📜 Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Handles image resizing, normalization, and conversion to appropriate formats.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Accepts input images and provides predictions for sentiment classes.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools to visualize input images and prediction results.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Dataset:** The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images with various facial expressions representing sentiments.
2. **Training:** The CNN learns features from the images to distinguish between different sentiments.
3. **Prediction:** After training, the model can predict sentiments for new input images.
4. **Visualization:** Displays the input image and overlays the predicted sentiment.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `model.h5`: The pre-trained model file.
- `train.py`: Script for training the model on labeled data.
- `predict.py`: Script to load the model and make predictions on new images.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for training, testing, and exploring the dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## ✨ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-prediction-using-images.git
   cd sentiment-prediction-using-images
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
   ```

## 📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset and generalizes well to unseen images. Example predictions are included in the repository.
